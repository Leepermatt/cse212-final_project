# Linked Lists
## What is a linked list?
A linked list is a method of stroing data in Python that allows either a single or double linked "nodes". If it sis a single linked then the information only will travle in a single direction, while a double linked list allows the last as well as the first items to be linked. 

## What is the benefits?
* This allows infortamtion to be added and removed without having to change the index of the items
* Memory usage is limited due to no need to store contiguously.
* While is does not have a O(1) like an array, it is a O(n) of time complexity.
## When to use?
* You want to insert items easily in between other items
* The size of the total collection is unknown
* You donâ€™t need random access when searching for items
* There is no concern about memory usage for storing the data
